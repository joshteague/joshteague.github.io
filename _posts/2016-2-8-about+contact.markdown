**Hi there!**

Iâ€™m Josh Teague, an Atlanta-based product designer, husband, and father of three. By day, I lead the design team at [FullStory](//www.fullstory.com), where we are busy building the future of customer experience tools. Before that, I spent a little over 4 years at <span class='g'>G</span><span class='o1'>o</span><span class='o2'>o</span><span class='g'>g</span><span class='l'>l</span><span class='o1'>e</span>, designing Search, Gmail, Chrome, Developer Tools, and more. The heart of what I do involves an obessive, nuanced, iterative problem-solving process.

Outside of work I enjoy dance parties with my three little girls, nights out with my wife, discussing the grace-centered gospel message, shoes, and photography.

#### Say hello :)

I love to connect with local designers and creative people, so [email me](mailto: joshteague@gmail.com) if you'd like to get a coffee one morning. Of course, you can catch me [on Twitter](//www.twitter.com/joshteague), too.
