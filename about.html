			    <article class="post">
			    <p>I'm an obsessive product designer based in Atlanta, GA. And this site is where I write about the process of design, iteration, problem solving, and all the nuances along the way.</p>

			    <p>Lately I've been spending my time designing <a href="//fullstory.com">FullStory</a> â€” a app that helps product teams understand how <em>actual humans</em> use their product and, in turn, helps guide thoughtful product direction. I'm extremely proud of the team I get to work with every day.</p>

			    <p>Prior to FullStory, I spent just over 4 years at Google as a UX Designer. While there, I had the opportunity to work on dozens of inspiring projects including Gmail, Search, Chrome, AdWords and more. And while I miss the friends and talent that surrounded me Seattle and San Francisco, I'm happy to be home and more passionate than ever about the technology and design scene in Atlanta.</p>

			    <p>Interested in getting together for coffee or lunch? Let's do it! Hit me up on <a href='//twitter.com/joshteague'>Twitter</a> or <a href='/contact.html'>over here</a>.</p>
